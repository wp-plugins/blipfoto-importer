	What it does
	------------

	Blipfoto (https://www.polaroidblipfoto.com) is an online daily photo journal. Each day you can upload one photo and add some words. It is also a very friendly community where you can comment on and rate other people's photos.

	Blipfoto Importer lets you easily import all your photos and journal entries from Blipfoto into your WordPress website.



	-----
	About
	-----

	This plugin is not an official Blipfoto product.
	I have written it as a result of concerns about the future of the Blipfoto website, as a way for people to retrieve all their text and photos and safely store them on their own WordPress website.
